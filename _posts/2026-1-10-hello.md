# Hello!!

This is our first ever post on this blog. Wow. We are going to be honest, we have NO idea what we're doing! We have never dabbled in web development before, so this is new for us. The site is running on Github Pages with Jekyll. Literally learning how to use this as we write this.

Starting out the site is ultimately going to be a little messy and unprofessional looking. That's okay. We're learning! We're looking forward to where we'll take this and maybe, years later, we'll still be writing to this blog. God, think of it\... Hello, future us!! From the future!!

Anyway, there is not much for us to say at the moment, but we promise there is a lot to come ahead. There may be post droughts sometimes - but that's to be expected. Sometimes, we may not even have anything to share after weeks, and typically with these kinds of blogs there's gotta be at least *something* to share with each post, so\...! Hoping all things go well.

# Projects

So here is a list of what we are currently working on (as of writing), which we may post more on later. There's a lot of variety here, and we'll likely not write as much about more niche things like modding.

- "ABSI-4" Analog Synthesizer
- STILLCAST
- Various Rain World mods
- Torrential (Rain World Level Renderer)

ABSI-4 is the one we'll likely be posting about the most. It's been a very fun project so far and expect a post on it very soon! We won't be surprised if this becomes a DIY synth oriented blog, lol. But of course, we may upload our music here too and share the odd random thing that we randomly decide to create sometimes.

### Shelved Projects

These are projects that we may get to some day, but certainly are not a priority at the moment\...!

- HATE IN THE MACHINE
- OuroborOS
- Unnamed RPG involving a moth guy protagonist and his wacky adventures

All three are, of course, games - of reasonable size too! Except maybe OuroborOS. Chances are, OuroborOS may be the game we work on after STILLCAST, assuming of course we don't drop STILLCAST for it or something else! Some of these games already have some concept art / content made for it, and we'll certainly be uploading some of that here. In-fact, here you go! Have some.

Whew! That's one too many songs to share in one post, and that's only a fraction of them. Honestly not the happiest with them - our music style is constantly evolving, perhaps more than ever now as we transition to analog synthesizers. Cascading Walls is almost entirely analog! Just has some digital effects on it.

Anyway! There's not much else to say in this post, so we'll end it off here. I think that was a fair first post, no? Only took two hours to write, somehow\... Welp,  have a good morning, afternoon, night, whatever!
